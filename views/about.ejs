      <!-- What is BB84? -->
      <h2 class="mt-4">What is <strong>BB84</strong>?</h2>
      <p class="card-text">
        <strong>BB84</strong> is a way for two people—let’s call them Alice and Bob—to share a secret code so that nobody else can read their messages. 
        It was invented in <strong>1984</strong> by <strong>Charles Bennett</strong> and <strong>Gilles Brassard</strong>, and it uses the magic rules of <strong>quantum physics</strong> to keep everything safe.

      <!-- Why is it useful? -->
      <h2 class="mt-4">Why is it useful?</h2>
      <p class="card-text">
        BB84 relies on the fact that when you measure a photon, you disturb it—you make its quantum state “collapse.” 
        If someone (Eve, the spy) tries to eavesdrop by measuring those photons, she’ll accidentally change them. 
        Alice and Bob will notice something’s off and know their link isn’t safe. 
        That makes BB84 practically <strong>eavesdrop‑proof</strong>.

        <li>
          <strong>Setting up bases</strong><br>
          Alice has two special “glasses” she can use to send bits: the <strong>+ (rectilinear)</strong> basis and the <strong>× (diagonal)</strong> basis. 
          Each direction on a glass means either 0 or 1.<br>

        </li>
        <li class="mt-3">
          <strong>Sending photons</strong><br>
          Alice picks a random string of 0s and 1s and a random sequence of glasses (+ or ×). 
          For each bit, she polarizes a photon using the chosen glass.<br>

        </li>
        <li class="mt-3">
          <strong>Bob’s measurements</strong><br>
          Bob receives each photon but doesn’t know which glass was used. 
          He randomly chooses + or × to measure and notes down a 0 or 1 result.<br>

        </li>
        <li class="mt-3">
          <strong>Comparing bases</strong><br>
          Over a public (but non‑secret) channel, Alice and Bob share which glasses they used for each photon—<em>not</em> the actual bit values. 
          They keep only the bits where their choices matched.<br>

        </li>
        <li class="mt-3">
          <strong>Checking security</strong><br>
          To make sure nobody tapped in, Alice and Bob reveal a small subset of their kept bits and compare them. 
          If those match, the rest become their shared secret key.<br>
